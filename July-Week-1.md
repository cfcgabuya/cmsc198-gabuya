# July Week 1
## Todo
- 1. Continue tasks that are not yet finished
	* Integrate generated OCR files into project.
- 2. Image editing (specifically cropping a portion of the image).
	* Research on how to specifically get a portion of the image for image reading.
- 3. Allow scanning on PDF files.
	* Enable to use OCR on reading PDF files in the same way as reading images.

## Done
- [x] Continue tasks that are not yet finished.
	* Research material and generated code has been included in main project.
	* Time taken: 2 days
- [x] Image editing (specifically cropping a portion of the image).
	* With the use of the <canvas> HTML tag, specific areas of input images are cropped, and read through OCR.
	* Time taken: 3 days
	
## To be done
- [ ] Make small changes to image cropping code.
	* Polish up generated code and remove unnecessary lines.
- [ ] Allow scanning on PDF files.
	* Enable to use OCR on reading PDF files in the same way as reading images.

## Things learned
- 1. Images can be cropped using simple JavaScript through the use of the <canvas> HTML tags.
- 2. Images can be extracted from the <canvas> tag and be used as a separate image.

## Hardest task done this week
- Getting a specfic part of an image. I have not encountered the <canvas> HTML tag before and I took my time to research in order to understand it. It is a tedious task but it is fulfilling when done with it.
