## Things learned
- 1. Laravel is a clean and organized project framework.
- 2. It is manageable and somehow good to deploy projects on.

## Hardest task done this week
- Finding and fixing the error in the code since none of us has been exposed to Laravel before. I contacted one of the co-authors of the project (Ms. Kristel Diane Artificio) to help us solve the problem. It helped to know that it is best to ask advice from the original authors of the project to aid in understanding the project more, especially if one does not have much knowledge of how the project works.
