# June Week 3
## Todo
- 1. Research on Tesseract, OCR samples and related technology.
	* Research on OCR samples for image reading of documents.
	* Allow consideration of different file type inputs.
- 2. Implement research on project.
	* Apply what is learned from research to be used on the project.
- 3. Enable user to edit input data in case of error in image reading.
	* Allow user to edit read data in case of error in image reading.
	
## Done
- [x] Research on Tesseract, OCR samples and related technology.
	* Researched about OCR, samples and demonstrations, and viewed sample codes. Consideration of different file type inputs is not yet done since I still have to understand dealing with simple image files.
	* Time taken: 2 days
- [x] Implement research on project.
	* Applied what is learned from research to be used on the project. Since there were many OCR samples provided online, we studied at least two of them and used the one which will work best in the project.
	* Time taken: 3 days
- [x] Enable user to edit input data in case of error in image reading.
	* Allow user to edit read data in case of error in image reading.
	* Time taken: less than one hour
	
## To be done
- [ ] Continue tasks that are not yet finished.
	* Integrate generated OCR files into project.
- [ ] Image editing (specifically cropping a portion of the image).
	* Research on how to specifically get a portion of the input image for image reading.
- [ ] Allow scanning on PDF files.
	* Enable to use OCR on reading PDF files in the same way as reading images.

## Things learned
- 1. I learned about OCR and how it can read characters in image files.
- 2. OCR can be terminal-based or browser-based. In our case, we needed to use the latter since it can be used in the project.

## Hardest task done this week
- None, but it is challenging to get just a part of an image to read since the OCR being used (OCRAD.js) reads the image as a whole and reads all characters in the image. Therefore, image editing and cropping is recommended and that will be my task for next week.
